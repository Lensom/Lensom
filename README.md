## Little Bit About Me

I am a front-end developer with 5 years of experience. 

I am very organized and attentive to details in projects. Ready to take the initiative and
try to learn from mistakes. I multitask and adapt well to new situations. I can successfully
meet deadlines and work independently with little or no supervision.  I also feel that I can
connect well with people.
